        <h3 id="subtitle">People who are experiencing homelessness are often unfairly stereotyped because of social media. We often see them depicted in a negative light and categorized as lazy, mentally ill, and aggressive. As a result, it makes it more difficult for those in need to gain the help that they need. This is where you can lend a helping hand to help those in need.</h3>

      <p class="revealable">Homelessness is a condition where individuals or families lack a stable and secure place to live. As of 2023, there are over half a million people experiencing homelessness in the United States alone and many more around the world. There are many causes of homelessness including, the lack of affordable housing, unemployment, and low wages. Although there are temporary shelters available, most homeless individuals still reside in places that are not meant for habitation. Even with access to available shelters, there are often safety concerns that turn many homeless people away from seeking help from these shelters. As a result, homelessness not only deprives people of a stable and safe place to live but also exposes them to numerous health risks, social exclusion, and a cycle of poverty that can be difficult to escape. Homelessness is not only an issue for adults but also for many children and young adults.</p>
